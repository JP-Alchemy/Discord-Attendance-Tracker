# Discord Attendance Tracker

This is a Basic Discord Bot that detects how long a user is online, offline or away in Discord.
Use `!summary` to get the list of commands and usage info.

## Run Any of the `.bat` files to execute the desired task
- `_BuildAndUpload.bat`: Builds the code and uploads and installs to the server as well as runs the server for you!
- `_ResetServer.bat`: Reset/Restarts the server and clears the Cache.
- `_StopServer.bat`: Simply stops the server from running.

## Use Case
For identifying if students / workers are active on their Computers for a certain duration of time (online status).

## Note
It is prone to false negatives if status of profile is changed manually and tracking profile activity on any social platform/instant messaging site is not a good way to track peoples productivity or work ethic.
